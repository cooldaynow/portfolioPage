        Bruce Wayne was born to the wealthy doctor Thomas Wayne and his wife
        Martha, who were themselves members of the prestigious Wayne and Kane
        families of Gotham City, respectively.

        When he was very young, Bruce's mother Martha was expecting a second
        child to be named Thomas Wayne, Jr. However, because of her intent to
        found a school for the underprivileged in Gotham, she was targeted by
        the manipulative Court of Owls, who arranged for her to get into a car
        accident. She and Bruce survived, but the accident forced Martha into
        premature labour, and the baby was lost.{' '}

        While on vacation to forget about these events, the Wayne Family butler,
        Jarvis Pennyworth was killed by one of the Court of Owls' Talons. A
        letter he'd written to his son Alfred, warning him away from the
        beleaguered Wayne family, was never delivered. As such, Alfred - who had
        been an actor at the Globe Theatre at the time and a military medic
        before that, travelled to Gotham City to take up his father's place,
        serving the Waynes as butler.
